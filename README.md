# Credit Card Approval

This is an end to end development of a Credit card approval project where I took various factors such as gender, marriage, realty, income, profession, housing for building the models. After preprocessing and cleaning the dataset ML models were run such as DecisionTree, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

Result of XGBoost classifier:

Since the datasets were imbalanced the results are skewed, to overcome this I used SMOTE for balancing the data and the results are as follows for the Random Forest Classifier.

The frontend of the project was developed using Flask, and HTML.
